            <p class="black-body">The first week of immersing ourselves in the new frontend frameworks introduced by our mentors was akin to diving headfirst into a vast, unfamiliar ocean. The initial waves of information were overwhelming, each framework presenting its unique syntax, components, and logic. It was a steep learning curve, but with every passing day, the water began to feel less turbulent.<br><br>Our mentors, experienced surfers in this digital sea, were invaluable guides. Their patient explanations and practical demonstrations were like buoys, keeping us afloat during the initial struggles. We found ourselves spending countless hours poring over documentation, experimenting with different approaches, and seeking clarification from our mentors. Gradually, the patterns started to emerge, and the code began to make more sense.</p>
